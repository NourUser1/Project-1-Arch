24/10 We read the project requirements, planned the work, and began addapting the Single Cycle to the project + Journal inception.



29/10 We successfuly addapted the Single Cycle (added the given support code) and began on adding the I-Type Inst.



30/10 I-Type Inst fixing and testing + testing R-Type Inst from previous lab code.



01/11 I-Type Inst fixing and testing + Working on some code fixes (Adjusting the modules for the new code and previous errors reappearing).



02/11 I-Type Inst finalizing + adding Branch and fixing some shifting problems.



03/11 Adding the EBREAK, FENCE, ECALL + Further testing + debugging previous errors (syntax and some problems that apperared early on when we added the support code in the imm gen)



04/11 Final testing + Gathering screenshots and report inception



05/11 Journal End + txt file + report end.



21/11 Milestone revison + Lab Work Transition (Taking the already made pipelined implemetation of 4 registers and putting our previous milestone on it AND taking the forwarding unit while removing the hazarding unit)



22/11 Jornal update + Finishing support for the previously unsupported Instructions (Branching)



23/11 Finishing support for the previously unsupported Instructions (Branching, JAL & JALR) + Began developing the New Single Memory by redirecting the input and outputs of every stage and revising the Clock.




24/11 Finishing support for the previously unsupported Instructions (Branching, JAL & JALR) + Revising the Clock + Making Test cases + Modyfying the main CU




25/11 Finishing support for the previously unsupported Instructions (Branching, JAL & JALR, Imm) + Adjusting the Datapath for the new code and Error Handeling previous mistakes.



26/11 Started the Report and continued work on the new Datapath + Fbga testing (Failed due to new memeory adjustements) + BONUS MULTIPLICATION
